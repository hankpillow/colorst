colorst
=======

this is a **personal project** I created to make easier reading svn status/log/switch etc.

###install:

- place `colorst` file into a place where your $PATH points at; or
- export PATH="/my-local-repo/colorst:$PATH"

###usage:

go to a svn repo and type:

	svn st | colorst

the output seems like this:
